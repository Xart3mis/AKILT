**AKILT** aims to help security enthusiasts and malware analysts better understand how botnets work by providing an open source example of an advanced botnet.

### Setup
#### You can download one of the prebuilt binaries to test it.
#### Or build from source by following these steps:
###### Install the dependencies:
  - a gcc compiler [(download TDM-GCC from here)](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/download/)  
  - make (download [make](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/make) using [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install))
  - Go [(download the golang installer from here)](https://go.dev/dl/)
  
  
###### After installing the dependencies above. Run these commands.
```bash
git clone github.com/Xart3mis/AKILT
```  

```bash
cd AKILT
```  

```bash
make
```  

**NOTE: Compiling the client only works on windows 64-bit**  
###### If you'd like to compile the client or server seperately. Run the following commands.:
```bash
make clean
```  

instead of running `make` directly run `make client` or `make server`  


##### the compiled binaries will appear in `Client/bin/` and `Server/bin/`
